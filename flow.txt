# State
{
  view: 'collections/new_collection/edit_collection',
  focussed_collection: { ['id']: { ... } }
};

# UX

1. The user should see no collections, but a 'create collection' button (wrapped in a collections_list div)
2. 'create new collection' should have an onclick event of create_new_collection_form
3. Clicking 'create new collection' should change the view to 'new_collection'
4. There should be two text boxes, name and description, and two buttons, create and cancel
5. Cancel should change the value of both text boxes to blank and the view to collections
6. Create should do the same as cancel, but also add the data to collections by a POST request to /collection

7. The user should now see one single collection above a 'create collection' button.
8. The user should see meta data about the collection 
9. And each collection should have an onclick event of edit_collection_form

10. Clicking the collection should produce an edit_collection_form similar to create_new_collection_form,
11. but with the option to add words, which will be in the following format
12. There will be empty textboxes to fill in each word category and a plus button to add it
13. The word will be appended to the edit_collection_form, and then the textboxes below it
14. Each word will display it's metadata (e.g. score)
15. Each added word will appear with an edit button to edit and a minus button which will delete the word
