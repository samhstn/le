# Learning environment

To start the app run:

`git clone https://github.com/shouston3/le.git && cd le && npm i && npm start`

## Why

I would like to create a language learning environment.
Its quite nice to go through learning some new words in other languages in my spare time

I have a previous working version here: [this](http://shouston3.github.io/learnenv). However this is only a front end.
It is merely proof of concept.
